üìñ Description
The EVM Sweeper Bot is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to automatically manage and transfer crypto assets from multiple EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) wallets to a single destination address. It supports sweeping native tokens (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC), ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs. The bot features a dynamic CLI display, with a header box that changes color and font with each launch for a unique visual experience.

‚ú® Key Features
Automatic Sweeping: Periodically checks wallet balances and transfers all assets to a designated address.

Multi-Asset Support: Capable of sweeping native tokens, ERC-20, and NFTs.

Gas Relayer: Uses a separate relayer wallet to fund gas fees for empty wallets.

Interactive CLI Display: Features a stylish and dynamic header with rolling color and font effects.

Easy Configuration: All key settings are managed through a config.json file.

Menu-Driven UI: Provides a user-friendly menu to select the asset type and network.
